# Overview

Use this section to outline the vision for the product to be developed, including a use case diagram that shows the main user interactions with the product, in order to provide readers with an overview of the project.

# Design

## User Stories

Describe the user stories designed for the project, including clear acceptance criteria and point estimate for each of them. User stories must be consistent with the use case diagram. Refer to the user stories using US#1, US#2, etc. At least one of the user stories, not related to user creation or authentication, must be detailed by a sequence diagram. 

## Model 

At a minimum, this section should have a class diagram that succinctly describes the main classes designed for this project, as well as their associations.

# Development Process 

This section should be used to describe how the scrum methodology was used in this project. As a suggestion, include the following table to summarize how the sprints occurred during the development of this project.

|Sprint#|Goals|Start|End|Done|Observations|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|US#1, US#2, ...|mm/dd/23|mm/dd/23|US#1|...|

Use the observations column to report problems encountered during a sprint and/or to reflect on how the team has continuously improved its work.

Feel free to use your own format for this section, as long as you are able to communicate what has been described here.

# Testing 

Share in this section the results of the tests performed to attest to the quality of the developed product, including the coverage of the tests in relation to the written code. There is no minimum code coverage expectation for your tests, other than expecting "some" coverage through at least one white-box and one black-box test.

# Deployment 

The final product must demonstrate the integrity of at least 5 of the 6 planned user stories. The final product must be packaged in the form of a docker image. In this section, describe the steps needed to generate that image so that others can deploy the product themselves. All files required for the deployment must be available, including the docker file, source/binary code, external package requirements, data files, images, etc. Instructions on how to create a container from the docker image with parameters such as port mapping, environment variables settings, etc., must be described (if needed).
